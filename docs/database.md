# Interacting with Database

- You can log into MySQL and run any query in the default database (`wordpress`) by using:

```sh
composer server db
```

- Use `composer server info` to retrieve MySQL info, connection details and forwarded ports:

```sh
Root password:  wordpress

Database:       wordpress
User:           wordpress
Password:       wordpress

Version:        5.7.26-1debian9
Ports:          0.0.0.0:32791
```
